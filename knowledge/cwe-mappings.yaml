  CWE-125:
    name: Out-of-bounds Read
    description: The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
    abstraction: Base
    applicable_platforms:
    - Memory-Unsafe
    - C
    - C++
    - ICS/OT
    consequences:
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Read Memory
      note: An attacker could get secret values such as cryptographic keys, PII, memory addresses, or other information that
        could be used in additional attacks.
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
      note: Out-of-bounds memory could contain memory addresses or other information that can be used to bypass ASLR and other
        protection mechanisms in order to improve the reliability of exploiting a separate weakness for code execution.
    - scope: Availability
      impact: 'DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart'
      note: An attacker could cause a segmentation fault or crash by causing memory to be read outside of the bounds of the
        buffer. This is especially likely when the code reads a variable amount of data and assumes that a sentinel exists
        to stop the read operation, such as a NUL in a string.
    mitigations:
    - Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable
      inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not stric
    - Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.

    name: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
    description: The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in
      output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
    abstraction: Base
    applicable_platforms:
    - Not Language-Specific
    - AI/ML
    - Web Based
    - Web Server
    consequences:
    - scope: Access Control
      impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
      note: The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of private information stored
        in user cookies, such as session information. Typically, a malicious user will craft a client-side script, which --
        when parsed by a web browser -- performs some activity on behalf of the victim to an attacker-controlled system (such
        as sending all site cookies to a given E-mail address). This could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim
        has administrator privileges to manage that site. This script will be loaded and run by each user visiting the web
        site. Since the site requesting to run the script has access to the cookies in question, the malicious script does
        also.
    - scope: Integrity
      impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
      note: In some circumstances it may be possible to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer when cross-site scripting
        is combined with other flaws, for example, "drive-by hacking."
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
      note: The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is stored or reflected. The difference is
        in how the payload arrives at the server. XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity
        from an annoyance to complete account compromise. Some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate
        or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information,
        or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes. Other damaging attacks include
        the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirecting the user to some other page or
        site, running "Active X" controls (under Microsoft Internet Explorer) from sites that a user perceives as trustworthy,
        and modifying presentation of content.
    mitigations:
    - Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness
      easier to avoid [REF-1482]. Examples of libraries and frameworks that make i

    name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
    description: The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component,
      but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when
      it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs,
      the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

    consequences:
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
      note: Adversaries could execute system commands, typically by changing the SQL statement to redirect output to a file
        that can then be executed.
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Read Application Data
      note: Since SQL databases generally hold sensitive data, loss of confidentiality is a frequent problem with SQL injection
        vulnerabilities.
    - scope: Authentication
      impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
      note: If poor SQL commands are used to check user names and passwords or perform other kinds of authentication, it may
        be possible to connect to the product as another user with no previous knowledge of the password.

  CWE-416:
    name: Use After Free
    description: The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may
      be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the
      new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code
      that operates on the new pointer.
    abstraction: Variant
    applicable_platforms:
    - Memory-Unsafe
    - C
    - C++
    consequences:
    - scope: Integrity
      impact: Modify Memory
      note: The use of previously freed memory may corrupt valid data, if the memory area in question has been allocated and
        used properly elsewhere.
    - scope: Availability
      impact: 'DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart'
      note: If chunk consolidation occurs after the use of previously freed data, the process may crash when invalid data
        is used as chunk information.
    - scope: Integrity
      impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
      note: If malicious data is entered before chunk consolidation can take place, it may be possible to take advantage of
        a write-what-where primitive to execute arbitrary code. If the newly allocated data happens to hold a class, in C++
        for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is
        overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.
    mitigations:
    - Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.
    - When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex
      data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.

    description: The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component,
      but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when
      it is sent to a downstream component.

    - AI/ML
    - Web Server
    consequences:
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
      note: Attackers could execute unauthorized operating system commands, which could then be used to disable the product,
        or read and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application
        is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application
        or the application's owner.
    mitigations:
    - If at all possible, use library calls rather than external processes to recreate the desired functionality.
    - Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the
      operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a par

        leading to excessive consumption of resources such as memory and CPU.

    name: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
    description: The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside
      the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could
      be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.
    abstraction: Class
    applicable_platforms:
    - Memory-Unsafe
    - C
    - C++
    - Assembly
    - Not Technology-Specific
    consequences:
    - scope: Integrity
      impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
      note: If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary
        code, as with a standard buffer overflow. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or
        64 bits), they can alter the intended control flow by redirecting a function pointer to their own malicious code.
        Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because
        the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite
        security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an administrator.
    - scope: Availability
      impact: Read Memory
      note: Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions,
        possibly leading to a crash. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program
        into an infinite loop.
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Read Memory
      note: In the case of an out-of-bounds read, the attacker may have access to sensitive information. If the sensitive
        information contains system details, such as the current buffer's position in memory, this knowledge can be used to
        craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.

      impact: Modify Files or Directories
      note: The attacker may be able to overwrite or create critical files, such as programs, libraries, or important data.
        If the targeted file is used for a security mechanism, then the attacker may be able to bypass that mechanism. For
        example, appending a new account at the end of a password file may allow an attacker to bypass authentication.

      impact: Read Files or Directories
      note: The attacker may be able read the contents of unexpected files and expose sensitive data. If the targeted file
        is used for a security mechanism, then the attacker may be able to bypass that mechanism. For example, by reading
        a password file, the attacker could conduct brute force password guessing attacks in order to break into an account

    consequences:
    - scope: Confidentiality
      impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
      note: The consequences will vary depending on the nature of the functionality that is vulnerable to CSRF. An attacker
        could trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest,
        etc., which would then be treated as an authentic request from the client - effectively performing any operations
        as the victim, leading to an exposure of data, unintended code execution, etc. If the victim is an administrator or
        privileged user, the consequences may include obtaining complete control over the web application - deleting or stealing
        data, uninstalling the product, or using it to launch other attacks against all of the product's users. Because the
        attacker has the identity of the victim, the scope of CSRF is limited only by the victim's privileges.

      note: Arbitrary code execution is possible if an uploaded file is interpreted and executed as code by the recipient.
        This is especially true for web-server extensions such as .asp and .php because these file types are often treated
        as automatically executable, even when file system permissions do not specify execution. For example, in Unix environments,
        programs typically cannot run unless the execute bit is set, but PHP programs may be executed by the web server without
        directly invoking them on the operating system.

      note: This weakness can generally lead to undefined behavior and therefore crashes. When the calculated result is used
        for resource allocation, this weakness can cause too many (or too few) resources to be allocated, possibly enabling
        crashes if the product requests more resources than can be provided.

      note: If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also,
        if the overflow/wraparound results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur.

      impact: Varies by Context
      note: The consequences can vary widely, because it depends on which objects or methods are being deserialized, and how
        they are used. Making an assumption that the code in the deserialized object is valid is dangerous and can enable
        exploitation. One example is attackers using gadget chains to perform unauthorized actions, such as generating a shell.

      been tainted. For example, a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) could be '
    - When deserializing data, populate a new object rather than just deserializing. The result is that the data flows through
