    name: Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs
    description: In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization
      framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly
      URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker
      may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained
      by ACLs can obtain sensitive informatio

    abstraction: Standard
    prerequisites:
    - The application must be navigable in a manner that associates elements (subsections) of the application with ACLs.
    - The various resources, or individual URLs, must be somehow discoverable by the attacker
    - The administrator must have forgotten to associate an ACL or has associated an inappropriately permissive ACL with a
      particular navigable resource.

    description: Buffer Overflow attacks target improper or missing bounds checking on buffer operations, typically triggered

      captured, the attacker performs malicious actions by using the stolen token with the targeted application to impersonate

      by the application to form the full command to be executed.

    - All user-controllable input should be validated and filtered for potentially unwanted characters. Using an allowlist
      for input is desired, but if use of a denylist approach is necessary, then focusing

    description: An adversary sends a TCP segment with the ACK flag set to a remote host for the purpose of determining if
      the host is alive. This is one of several TCP 'ping' types. The RFC 793 expected behavior for a service is to respond
      with a RST 'reset' packet to any unsolicited ACK segment that is not part of an existing connection. So by sending an
      ACK segment to a port, the adversary can identify that the host is alive by looking for a RST packet. Typically, a remote
      server will respond with a RST regar
    likelihood: ''
    severity: Low
    abstraction: Detailed
    prerequisites:
    - The ability to send an ACK packet to a remote host and identify the response. Creating the ACK packet without building
      a full connection requires the use of raw sockets. As a result, it is not possible to send a TCP ACK ping from some
      systems (Windows XP SP 2) without the use of third-party packet drivers like Winpcap. On other systems (BSD, Linux)
      administrative privileges are required in order to write to the raw socket.
    - The target must employ a stateless firewall that lacks a rule set that rejects unsolicited ACK packets.
    - The adversary requires the ability to craft custom TCP ACK segments for use during network reconnaissance. Sending an
      ACK ping requires the ability to access "raw sockets" in order to create the packets with direct access to the packet
      header.

      By using a privleged thread to do their bidding, adversaries can evade process-based detection that would stop an attack
      that creates a new process. This can lead to an adversary gaining access to the process's memory and can also enable
      elevated privileges. The most common way to perform this attack is by suspending an existing thread and manipulating
      its memory.

    - The application in question employs a threaded model of execution with the threads operating at, or having the ability

      This ability includes, but is not limited to, modifying environment variables that affect the process the thread belongs
      to, or calling native OS calls that can suspend and alter process memory. This does not preclude network-based attacks,
