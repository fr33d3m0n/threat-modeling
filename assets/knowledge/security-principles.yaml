# Security Principles - Core security principles for threat modeling
# Each principle: one-line definition
# Referenced in: Phase 1, 2, 3, 4

principles:
  defense_in_depth:
    code: DID
    name: Defense in Depth
    definition: "Multiple independent security layers; single failure does not compromise system."

  least_privilege:
    code: LP
    name: Least Privilege
    definition: "Grant minimum permissions required; no access by default."

  zero_trust:
    code: ZT
    name: Zero Trust
    definition: "Never trust, always verify; authenticate every request regardless of origin."

  fail_secure:
    code: FS
    name: Fail Secure
    definition: "On error or exception, deny access rather than grant."

  separation_of_duties:
    code: SOD
    name: Separation of Duties
    definition: "No single entity controls entire critical operation; require multiple parties."

  security_by_default:
    code: SBD
    name: Security by Default
    definition: "Secure configuration out of box; user must explicitly disable protections."

  complete_mediation:
    code: CM
    name: Complete Mediation
    definition: "Every access to every resource must be checked for authorization."

  economy_of_mechanism:
    code: EOM
    name: Economy of Mechanism
    definition: "Keep security mechanisms simple; complexity breeds vulnerabilities."

  open_design:
    code: OD
    name: Open Design
    definition: "Security should not depend on secrecy of design; only keys should be secret."

  input_validation:
    code: IV
    name: Input Validation
    definition: "Never trust external input; validate type, length, format, range at trust boundary."

  least_agency:
    code: LA
    name: Least Agency
    definition: "Limit AI agent autonomy, tool access, and decision scope to minimum required for task completion."

# Phase mapping
phase_reference:
  phase_1: [DID, LP, ZT, LA]       # Project understanding - identify design gaps, agent scope
  phase_2: [CM, IV, ZT]            # DFD analysis - identify trust boundaries
  phase_3: [ZT, SOD, LP, LA]       # Trust boundaries - evaluate access controls, agent boundaries
  phase_4: [ALL]                   # Security design - full principle assessment (11 principles)
